## Installation

### **Dev**
To set up development environment in your local machine, follow these steps. 

1. To use your smartphone as a debug device

  * Make sure your laptop and mobile are on a same network
  * Turn on developer mode on your mobile
  * Turn on wifi-debugging
  * Locate platform-tools in your laptop
    * For mac/linux path is: /home/$USERNAME/Android/Sdk/platform-tools
    * For windows path is: C:\Users\$USERNAME\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools
  * Connect your phone to laptop via usb cable
  * Run these command from platform-tools directory
    * To check phone is connected; give permission from your phone to connect as USB Debugging if necessary

      ```bash
      adb devices
      ```
    * Restart adb in tcpip mode

      ```bash
      adb tcpip 5555
      ```
    * Find your device ip in About section in Mobile settings

      ```bash
      adb connect YOUR-DEVICE-IP
      ```
    
2. Clone github repo in your favoirate IDE, but for the sake of simplicity we are using Android Studio in this doc

  * Non-linux users can also install Github Desktop
  * Make sure to switch your branch from master
  * Run pub-get to get all dependencies
  * Run main_dev.dart

    ```bash
    flutter run -t main_dev.dart
    ```
  * If you try to login from the app, it will throw an error as Exception has occurred. PlatformException(sign_in_failed, Status{statusCode=ERROR, resolution=null}, null)
  * Run this command to get SHA certificate from debug.keystore which got generated by android sdk itself after first build in debug mode.

    * For mac/linux users
    ```bash
    keytool -list -v -keystore "Users/$USERNAME/.android/debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
    ```
    * For windows users
    ```bash
    keytool -list -v -keystore "C:\Users\$USERNAME\.android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
    ```
  * Add these SHA1 and SHA256 strings to firebase project settings
  * Download _google-services.json_ file
  * Replace project's _google-services.json_ content with downloaded _google-services.json_
  * Run main_dev.dart again to start your development journey at **Kohbee**

    ```bash
    flutter run -t main_dev.dart
    ```
  * Happy Coding!
